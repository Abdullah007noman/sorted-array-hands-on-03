## Time Complexity Analysis:


Let K be the number of arrays and N be the size of each array
Total number of elements = K × N
For each element:

Insertion into heap: O(log K)
Extraction from heap: O(log K)


We perform these operations for all K×N elements
Therefore, total time complexity is O(K×N × log K)
Space Complexity:

Heap size: O(K) - stores one element from each array
Result array: O(K×N) - stores all elements
Total space complexity: O(K×N)

The current implementation (in this repository) using a min-heap is generally considered optimal for most practical cases, as it achieves O(K×N × log K) time complexity, which is asymptotically optimal for this problem. The choice between these improvements would depend on specific use cases and constraints (memory limitations, parallel processing availability, etc.).
Divide and Conquer Approach:

Instead of merging all arrays at once, we could merge pairs of arrays
This could be more cache-friendly for very large arrays
Time complexity would still be O(K×N × log K) but with better constants


Parallel Processing:

For very large arrays, we could parallelize the merging process
Different pairs of arrays could be merged simultaneously
This would significantly improve performance on multi-core systems


Memory Optimization:

Current implementation creates a new result array
Could modify to work in-place if memory is a constraint
Would increase time complexity but save space


Early Termination:

If we only need the first M elements of the merged array
Could modify the algorithm to stop after finding M elements
Would improve performance for partial results


Custom Heap Implementation:

Current implementation uses Python's heapq
Could implement a specialized heap structure optimized for this specific use case
Might improve constant factors in performance
